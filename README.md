## 🚀 About Me:  

**"Swift as the wind, strong as a titan. Today's failure is tomorrow's success."**  
This phrase resonates deeply with me. Even in the face of the battles we face, I believe we need to act with resilience to achieve success. As a child, I got my first video game and started developing an interest in technology. In my second year of high school, I decided to pursue **Computer Science** at **CESAR School** and was accepted mid-year while still in my senior year. I completed a fast-track program and successfully enrolled in the place I always dreamed of.  

## Achievements and Goals  
- Completed the **Python Programming Fundamentals** course at college.  
- Earned the **CISCO Basic Python** certificate.
- At the moment I am learning C  
- Next goals:  
  - "Develop a repository in C when I finish my studies(there is already a repository in C, but I am still studying, check it in the repositories tab)."  
  - Study a Framework in Python like Django.  
  - Learn **Java** as a new programming language, after finish learning C.  

## Core Values  
- I am a very communicative person and love teamwork.  
- I believe that teamwork leads to better results.  
- I greatly value a healthy work environment.  

## Career Aspirations  
I intend to pursue a career in **Cybersecurity** or **QA**.
